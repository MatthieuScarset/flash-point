# /frontend/src/configs/strategy.yaml

# 1. World Configuration: Governs the overall physics and arena layout.
world:
  physics:
    gravity:
      x: 0
      y: 1.0   # Vertical gravity. We can make it stronger or weaker here.
  platform:
    width: 600 # Width of the player's building platform.
    height: 20 # Thickness of the platform.

# 2. Block Configuration: Defines the properties of the hexagons.
blocks:
  # Properties for "Stable" blocks, spawned from BUY orders.
  stable:
    label: 'stable_block'
    friction: 0.9      # High friction, easier to stack.
    restitution: 0.1   # Low bounciness.
    render:
      fillStyle: '#4A90E2' # A calming blue color.

  # Properties for "Volatile" blocks, spawned from SELL orders.
  volatile:
    label: 'volatile_block'
    friction: 0.1      # Low friction, slippery and hard to stack.
    restitution: 0.7   # High bounciness.
    render:
      fillStyle: '#E94E77' # A vibrant pink/red color.

  # Controls how the trade `quantity` from the oracle maps to block size.
  sizing:
    min_radius: 20 # Smallest possible hexagon radius.
    max_radius: 45 # Largest possible hexagon radius.

# 3. Game Rules: Defines the core gameplay loop.
game:
  win_condition: 'max_height_at_timer' # The player with the highest tower at the end wins.
  session_duration: 180 # Match length in seconds.
  spawner:
    base_rate: 1.5 # How many seconds between each new block spawn, on average.
    surge_multiplier: 2.0 # How much faster blocks spawn during a liquidity surge.

# 4. Oracle Configuration: Defines where the market data comes from.
oracle:
  market_id: 'ETH-USD'  # The market pair to watch for trades.
  provider: 'YellowNetwork' # The L3 oracle provider.
